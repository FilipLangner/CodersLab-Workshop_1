# CodersLab-Workshop_1
This is my first repository on GitHub created as part of the CodersLab bootcamp

The repository consists of the following five mini programs utilizing basic python concepts:
1) Dice_roll.py - dice roll simulating function, taking a dice roll notation as parameter and returning the result of a dice roll. Functionality of note: regular expressions, error handling.

2) Guessing_game_1.0.py - a simple number guessing game, where computer randomly selects the number which the user then tries to guess. Functionality of note: while-loop, error handling.

3) Guessing_game_2.0.py - a reversed number guessing game, where it's the user who selects the number and computer tries to guess it. Functionality of note: formatted string, while-loop.

4) Guessing_game_3.0.py - a version of guessing_game_2.0 implemented in Flask. Functionality of note: Flask, templates, jinja2.

5) Lotto_simulator.py - lottery drawing simulator, where the user inputs 6 numbers ranging from 1 to 49 and the program draws 6 numbers from same range and presents the result. Functionality of note: while-loop, for-loop.
